**Here are some questions for the students to cover during their presentations:**


What was your requirements gathering and design process? 
- Was it useful/successful?

I wanted to create a web application that interacted with a full API, unlike my first mini project that only used a small API that I created. I looked into different fully fledged API's that I could interact with and decided upon a card game that had a massive database of card images and data.

Give a high level overview of your application and its features

Where does its data come from (external/internal APIs)?
- How is this data processed and displayed?

How can the user interact with your application?

How have you structured/broken up your components/code?

What kinds of React hooks have you used (eg. state, context, effect, navigate)? 
- How?

Have you created and used any custom hooks?

What external tools/libraries have you used (eg. bootstrap/axios/MUI)? 
- How? 
- Why?

How might you extend the features of your application in future?
